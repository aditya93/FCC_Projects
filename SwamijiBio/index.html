<ul>
  <li><b>1863 </b>Vivekananda was born Narendranath Datta in Calcutta, the capital of British India, on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival.</li>
  <li><b>1871 </b>At the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877</li>
  <li><b>1882 </b>Narendra went to Dakshineswar with two friends and met Ramakrishna. This meeting proved to be a turning point in his life.</li>
  <li><b>1884 </b>Completed a Bachelor of Arts degree</li>
  <li><b>1888 </b>Narendra left the monastery as a Parivrâjaka— the Hindu religious life of a wandering monk, "without fixed abode, without ties, independent and strangers wherever they go".</li>
  <li><b>1893 </b>Vivekananda started his journey to the West on 31 May 1893 and visited several cities in Japan (including Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama, Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo),China and Canada en route to the United States,reaching Chicago on 30 July 1893</li>
  <li><b>1893 </b>The Parliament of the World's Religions opened on 11 September 1893 at the Art Institute of Chicago as part of the World's Columbian Exposition.On this day, Vivekananda gave a brief speech representing India and Hinduism. He was initially nervous, bowed to Saraswati (the Hindu goddess of learning) and began his speech with <em>"Sisters and brothers of America!".</em> At these words, Vivekananda received a two-minute standing ovation from the crowd of seven thousand.</li>
  <li><b>1897 </b>Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission for social service. Its ideals are based on Karma Yoga,and its governing body consists of the trustees of the Ramakrishna Math. </li>
  <li><b>1899 </b>Despite declining health, Vivekananda left for the West for a second time accompanied by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States. During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California.</li>
  <li><b>1902 </b>On 4 July 1902 (the day of his death) Vivekananda awoke early, went to the chapel at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to pupils,later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00 p.m. Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:10 p.m. while meditating.</li>

  <blockquote class = "text-center"><h4>Swamiji's Quotes</h4>
    <p>"You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself."<br>
      "We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far."<br>
      "When an idea exclusively occupies the mind, it is transformed into an actual physical or mental state."<br>
"The more we come out and do good to others, the more our hearts will be purified, and God will be in them."<br>
